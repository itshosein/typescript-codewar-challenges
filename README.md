### challenges


<div id="detect-pangram"></div>

1. **Detect Pangram**

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

2. **Square Number**

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

3. **Equal Sides Of An Array**

You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

4. **Find the missing letter**

Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.

You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
The array will always contain letters in only one case.

5. **odd or even letter**

Given a list of integers, determine whether the sum of its elements is odd or even.

Give your answer as a string matching "odd" or "even".

If the input array is empty consider it as: [0] (array with a zero).
